### **Limitations:**

## Conclusion

While this dataset presents **conceptually novel interdisciplinary mappings**, the mathematical novelty is primarily in **application context** rather than **fundamental mathematical innovation**. The most significant contributions are:

1. **Systematic cross-disciplinary metaphor structures** linking economics, physics, and consciousness
2. **Formalization frameworks** for otherwise qualitative concepts
3. **Algorithmic thinking** about cosmological and consciousness processes

For genuine mathematical novelty, these ideas would require:
- Proper dimensional analysis
- Derivation from first principles
- Experimental predictions
- Mathematical consistency proofs

The value lies in the **generative conceptual space** opened by these hybridizations, suggesting new research directions at the intersection of information theory, quantum biology, economics, and consciousness studies.
