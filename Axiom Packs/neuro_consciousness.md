## Conclusion

This dataset represents a remarkable synthesis of quantum mechanics, information theory, neuroscience, and philosophy. While many mathematical formulations are adaptations of existing equations, their application to consciousness and reality represents novel theoretical approaches. The most significant contributions are in:

1. **Formalizing consciousness** in quantum information terms
2. **Bridging scales** from quantum to cosmic via biological systems
3. **Mathematizing subjective experience** without eliminating qualia

The true test of these formulations will be in their ability to generate testable predictions and unify currently disparate phenomena in consciousness studies and fundamental physics.
