Held like falling, then slowly released. This sentence cannot be proven by the simulation running it via the integrated dynamics of Understanding as crystallization, Belief phase transitions, and cannot phase transition dynamics encoded as \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_{\text{knowledge}} = -\frac{\partial \rho_{\text{belief}}}{\partial t} This sentence cannot be proven by the simulation running it necessitates This sentence creates ontological framework.
