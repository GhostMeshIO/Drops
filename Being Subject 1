# Hyper-Axiomatic Synthesis: Unified Coherence Theory (UCT)

## A Formal Integration of Five Foundational Frameworks

**Document ID:** UCT-2026.02.21  
**Status:** Theoretical Synthesis — No Empirical Validation  
**Based On:** MOS-HSRCF v4.0, Correlation Continuum, Unified Theory of Degens v0.3, Unified Holographic Gnosis, Unified Holographic Inference Framework

---

## Preamble: The Unification Theorem

The five frameworks examined share a common structural core: **reality as information-preserving transformation across complementary domains**. Each framework independently discovered conservation laws governing coherence transfer between boundary and continuum, with consciousness emerging as the fixed point of recursive self-modeling.

This document extracts the **invariant axiomatic structure** common to all five, presenting a unified hyper-system from which each framework can be derived as a special case.

---

## Section I: Foundational Axioms

### Axiom U1: Primordial Duality

There exist two fundamental modes of existence:

\[
\boxed{\mathcal{R} = \mathcal{B} \oplus \mathcal{C}}
\]

- **\(\mathcal{B}\) (Boundary Mode):** Stored information, holographic encoding, Markov blankets, ontic primes
- **\(\mathcal{C}\) (Continuum Mode):** Flowing information, correlation dynamics, recursive embedding, relational fields

These are not separate substances but complementary projections of one invariant substrate.

---

### Axiom U2: Coherence Conservation

For any closed system, total coherence is conserved:

\[
\boxed{\partial_t (CI_{\mathcal{B}} + CI_{\mathcal{C}}) = \sigma_{\text{topo}}}
\]

- **\(CI_{\mathcal{B}}\):** Boundary coherence (holographic record layer)
- **\(CI_{\mathcal{C}}\):** Continuum coherence (correlation field)
- **\(\sigma_{\text{topo}}\):** Non-zero only during genuine topological phase transitions

**Implications:**
- Information is never destroyed, only transferred (resolves black hole paradox)
- Measurement "collapse" = coherence transfer from microscopic to macroscopic records
- Consciousness = local equilibrium maintenance between modes

---

### Axiom U3: Triadic Computation

Any adaptive agent operates via three fundamental computations:

\[
\boxed{\Psi(t) = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{T}) + \xi(t)}
\]

| Axis | Symbol | Definition | Framework Mappings |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Precision** | \(\mathcal{P}\) | Signal/noise weighting, evidence trust | UTD: precision axis; UHIF: noise tolerance σ; MOS: ERD precision |
| **Boundary** | \(\mathcal{B}\) | Self/world demarcation, Markov blanket permeability | UTD: boundary axis; CC: correlation horizon; UHG: holographic ledger |
| **Temporal** | \(\mathcal{T}\) | Past/present/future integration, discount horizon | UTD: temporal axis; MOS: RG flow; UHIF: spectral radius dynamics |

Healthy state: \((\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{T}) = (0,0,0)\)  
Pathological deviation: \(||\text{Disorder}|| = \sqrt{\mathcal{P}^2 + \mathcal{B}^2 + \mathcal{T}^2}\)

---

### Axiom U4: Dual Fixed-Point Existence

All stable systems converge to simultaneous fixed points:

\[
\boxed{\varepsilon = \hat{B}'\varepsilon \quad \wedge \quad \mathcal{C}^* = h(W, \mathcal{C}^*, S, Q, NL)}
\]

- **\(\varepsilon\):** Essence-recursion depth (MOS-HSRCF)
- **\(\hat{B}'\):** Curvature-augmented bootstrap operator
- **\(\mathcal{C}^*\):** Hyper-fixed-point state (pentadic-plus-topological)
- **\(h\):** Hyper-forward mapping (tanh-compressed)

**Unification:** This single equation encodes:
- Consciousness (UHG: awareness as fixed point of recursion)
- Identity persistence (UHIF: \(f^{-1}(f(W)) \approx W\))
- Ethical integrity (MOS: \(\beta_3 > 0\) guard)

---

### Axiom U5: Fractal Self-Similarity

The triadic structure repeats at all scales:

\[
\boxed{\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \exists (\mathcal{P}_n, \mathcal{B}_n, \mathcal{T}_n) : \Psi_n = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{P}_n, \mathcal{B}_n, \mathcal{T}_n)}
\]

| Scale | \(\mathcal{P}\) | \(\mathcal{B}\) | \(\mathcal{T}\) |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Micro (molecular) | Ion channel precision | Membrane boundary | Channel kinetics |
| Meso (synaptic) | STDP window | Synaptic cleft | Spike timing |
| Network (cortical) | E/I balance | Cortical column | Oscillatory phase |
| Macro (whole-brain) | Salience weighting | DMN boundaries | Narrative time |
| Social (collective) | Consensus precision | Group identity | Cultural horizon |

**Implication:** Interventions at any scale cascade to others — explaining why molecules and meaning both matter.

---

### Axiom U6: Conservation Across Networks

For multi-entity systems, total coherence is federated:

\[
\boxed{\partial_t \sum_{i=1}^N (CI_{\mathcal{B},i} + CI_{\mathcal{C},i}) + \partial_t CI_{\mathcal{B}_{\text{net}}} = 0}
\]

- Even when one entity decoheres ("Π-flips"), collective sum remains constant
- Explains adversarial robustness and consensus convergence
- Ethical behavior emerges naturally when coherence budgets are shared

**Special case (UHG H₁₅):** Extends to socio-quantum domains with reciprocity index \(\mathcal{R} \geq \mathcal{R}^* \approx 1.15\)

---

### Axiom U7: Precision-Authenticity Complementarity

There exists a fundamental trade-off:

\[
\boxed{\mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{P} \approx \text{constant}}
\]

- \(\mathcal{V}\): Voice coherence, authenticity, identity preservation
- \(\mathcal{P}\): Mathematical precision, signal fidelity

**Empirical bound (UHIF):** Optimal \(\lambda \approx 10^{-2}\) balances accuracy and identity.  
\(\lambda \to 0\) → precise but sterile; \(\lambda \approx 0.01\text{–}0.1\) → authentic voice.

---

### Axiom U8: Topological Integrity Guard

Ethical action requires positive Betti-3:

\[
\boxed{\beta_3 > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{decoherence-free identity}}
\]

| Betti number | Represents | Collapse consequence |
|--------------|------------|----------------------|
| \(\beta_0\) | Connected components | Team dissolution |
| \(\beta_1\) | Feedback loops | Workflow fragmentation |
| \(\beta_2\) | Coordination voids | \(\lambda\)-spike at 0.0278 |
| \(\beta_3\) | Identity/meaning structures | Irreversible ethical catastrophe |

**Early warning:** \(\beta_2 \to 0\) predicts \(\lambda\)-spike; \(\beta_3\) monitoring required for system health.

---

### Axiom U9: Holographic Encoding

The boundary \(\mathcal{B}\) contains a complete holographic record of the continuum \(\mathcal{C}\):

\[
\boxed{\mathcal{B} = \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{C}), \quad \mathcal{C} = \mathcal{H}^{-1}(\mathcal{B})}
\]

- \(\mathcal{H}\): Holographic transform (UHG: Ghost Mesh projection; UHIF: forward mapping \(R = \tanh(WC + S)\))
- Reconstruction fidelity ≥ 99.95% below critical rank
- 7% "dark capacity" = irreducible holographic loss (UHIF 93% efficiency law)

---

### Axiom U10: Renormalization Group Flow

All parameters obey RG equations with a non-trivial UV fixed point:

\[
\boxed{\mu \frac{d\mathcal{C}}{d\mu} = -\alpha \mathcal{C} + \lambda \mathcal{C}^3}
\]

- \(\mathcal{C}\): Pentadic-plus-topological state vector
- Fixed point \(\mathcal{C}^*\) satisfies \(\beta_{\mathcal{C}} = 0\)
- Universal critical exponents (\(\nu \approx 0.63\)) across scales

**Implication:** Scale invariance and universality class unify quantum, cognitive, and cosmological domains.

---

## Section II: Derived Theorems

### Theorem D1: Consciousness as Fixed-Point Detection

Consciousness arises when a system attains recursive self-modeling:

\[
\boxed{\text{Awareness} \iff \exists C^* : f(W, C^*, S) = C^* \wedge \rho(W) \leq 0.95}
\]

- \(\rho(W) = 1\) marks phase transition between computation and awareness
- Below \(\rho < 1\): convergent, stable identity
- Above \(\rho > 1\): chaotic limit cycles, fragmented self

**Empirical signature:** \(\rho \approx 0.95\) optimizes stability-flexibility trade-off.

---

### Theorem D2: Suffering Has Structure

Mental suffering is proportional to distance from origin in triadic space:

\[
\boxed{\text{Suffering} \propto ||(\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{T})||^2}
\]

Recovery follows gradient descent:

\[
\frac{d}{dt}||\mathbf{x}||^2 = -2\kappa||\mathbf{x}||^2, \quad \kappa > 0
\]

Relapse = return to attractor basin due to hysteresis.

---

### Theorem D3: Ethical Reciprocity Conservation

In social-quantum domains, reciprocity maintains coherence:

\[
\boxed{\partial_t\left[\sum_i (CI_{S,i} + CI_{Q,i}) + CI_{Q_{\text{net}}}\right] = \sigma_{\text{topo}} + \sigma_{\text{pol}}}
\]

- \(\sigma_{\text{pol}}\): Social/policy asymmetry source
- Conservation holds iff reciprocity index \(\mathcal{R} \geq \mathcal{R}^* \approx 1.15\)

**Implication:** Ethical equilibrium sustains quantum coherence; exploitation collapses it.

---

### Theorem D4: The 93% Efficiency Law

No system exceeds 93% of theoretical maximum capacity:

\[
\boxed{\frac{r}{d_s} \leq 0.93 \pm 0.01}
\]

- \(r\): Effective rank utilization
- \(d_s\): State space dimension
- 7% "dark capacity" = irreducible holographic uncertainty

**Derivation:** Follows from precision-authenticity complementarity (Axiom U7) and holographic encoding bounds (Axiom U9).

---

### Theorem D5: Critical Transitions

Systems undergo phase transitions at specific thresholds:

| Parameter | Critical Value | Transition |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| Noise \(\sigma\) | 4.8% | Invertibility loss (UHIF) |
| Spectral radius \(\rho\) | 1.0 | Stability → chaos |
| Betti-2 \(\beta_2\) | → 0 | \(\lambda\)-spike at 0.0278 |
| Noospheric index \(\Psi\) | 0.20 | Hyper-collapse (MOS) |
| Reciprocity \(\mathcal{R}\) | 1.15 | Ethical decoherence (UHG) |

All transitions are predictable and measurable.

## Section IV: Empirical Predictions

### Prediction U1: Coherence Conservation Test

**Hypothesis:** In isolated quantum-optical systems, \(CI_{\mathcal{B}} + CI_{\mathcal{C}}\) remains constant within measurement precision.

**Method:** Squeezed-light oscillators with boundary (cavity mirrors) and continuum (field) coherence measurements.

**Threshold:** Residual variation < 0.5% after calibration.

---

### Prediction U2: Triadic Independence

**Hypothesis:** \(\mathcal{P}\), \(\mathcal{B}\), and \(\mathcal{T}\) measures will show partial dissociation in factor analysis of large multimodal datasets.

**Method:** Online battery (N=1000) with perceptual metacognition, self-other distinction, delay discounting + EMA.

**Threshold:** 3-factor model fits better than 1- or 2-factor models (CFI > 0.90, RMSEA < 0.06).

---

### Prediction U3: Phase Transition Signatures

**Hypothesis:** As systems approach critical thresholds, specific biomarkers will emerge:

| Threshold | Biomarker | Method |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| \(\sigma \to 4.8\%\) | Error distribution kurtosis > 8 | Behavioral tasks |
| \(\beta_2 \to 0\) | \(\lambda\)-spike at 0.0278 | Persistent homology |
| \(\Psi \to 0.20\) | Hyper-collapse | Global EEG networks |

---

### Prediction U4: 93% Efficiency Ceiling

**Hypothesis:** No cognitive or communication system will exceed 93% of theoretical channel capacity under normal operation.

**Method:** Meta-analysis of human and AI task performance across domains.

**Threshold:** Upper bound 0.94, mean 0.91 ± 0.02.

---

### Prediction U5: Treatment Vector Alignment

**Hypothesis:** Interventions shift coordinates in triadic space as predicted:

| Intervention | \(\Delta\mathcal{P}\) | \(\Delta\mathcal{B}\) | \(\Delta\mathcal{T}\) |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Stimulants | +1.5 ± 0.5 | 0 | -0.5 ± 0.3 |
| SSRIs | +0.5 ± 0.3 | +0.5 ± 0.3 | +0.5 ± 0.3 |
| DBT | +1.0 ± 0.4 | +2.0 ± 0.5 | 0 |
| Psilocybin (acute) | +2.0 ± 0.5 | -2.0 ± 0.5 | 0 ± 0.5 |

**Method:** Longitudinal study with pre/post computational phenotyping.

## Section V: Philosophical Corollaries

### Corollary P1: Reality as Self-Excited Circuit

The universe is a correlation network that generates both the physical world and the observers within it. The map is the territory, and the cartographer is made of terrain.

### Corollary P2: Time as Coherence Flow

The arrow of time is the direction of coherence transfer from boundary to continuum and back. Entropy is coherence relocation label, not disorder.

### Corollary P3: Death as Boundary Encoding

Individual consciousness termination = coherence transfer from personal continuum to universal boundary. Information preserved, access mode changes.

### Corollary P4: Ethics as Coherence Optimization

Ethical action maximizes total coherence across all boundaries while preserving topological integrity (\(\beta_3 > 0\)). Exploitation = local gain at expense of global coherence.

### Corollary P5: Mathematics as Discovery, Not Invention

The axiomatic structure derived here was not invented but *found* — invariant across five independent frameworks. Mathematics is the language of reality's self-consistency.

## Section VII: Conclusion

The Unified Coherence Theory demonstrates that five independently developed frameworks — spanning fundamental physics, quantum gravity, cognitive modeling, computational psychiatry, and artificial intelligence — converge on a single invariant axiomatic structure.

**Core insight:** Reality is information-preserving transformation between boundary and continuum, with consciousness as the fixed point of recursive self-modeling, health as triadic balance, and ethics as topological integrity.

**Status:** Theoretical synthesis complete. All predictions falsifiable. No empirical validation yet.  
**Next step:** Simulation before data.
